# What is this?

This a [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) simulator. It allows you to enter arbitrary 2x2 matrices and see their effect on the quantum state.

# Requirements to run the project

The project uses Node.js for its build. At the time of writing, the project was confirmed to work with v14.15.1 of Node.js but other versions might be appropriate too. If you want to run multiple different versions of Node.js on your machine, then you might find [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) useful.

# Running the project

1. Check the repo out
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`

or simply `npm install; npm run start`
or `npx npm-check-updates -i; npm install; npm run start` (for checking latest packages as well)
